    <h3>Seperation of church and state</h3>
    <h5>This seems to me to be an illusion based on the following paramaters.</h5>
    <ul><li>Churches aggregate material wealth.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Many churches accept money as donation, 'tithing', and compensation.</li>
          <li>Most accept other types of material donations while some have strict requirements about contribution.<br>Some even demand you give up all your material possession and give to church.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>One interesting thing to analyze is when churches begin doing cost benefit analysis of material wealth and start to blend into looking like a business or government
                  who receieves contribution from an investor that wants to be a partner in said entity (which said entity again? get it?).</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Many religions use a lot of this wealth in ways that are of great contribution to the world.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Churches are recognized in the court system.</li>
      <li>Does public policy override 'religious freedoms'?</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If so, at what levels?</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Religious views seem to influence public policy.</li>
      <li>Freedom of religion</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This has extended to protecting churches.</li>
          <li>We try to limit churches to influence public policy with policies against it... It is an attempt to keep the "seperation" but are these policies a breakdown in the theory itself? ( I like playing with words. :P )
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>This is just to question the view itself to analyze and understand it. It seems potentially unhealthy how dogmatic people believe this and what kind of paradox it creates even subconsciously on a widescale.</p>
